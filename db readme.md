# Hi my name is Dara 
 ## **This is my first assignment on the CBF Java bootcamp** 
 
### So far i have learnt a lot of information for example learning about command line interface. I have a windows laptop and was unaware that i could create, delete, update repositories and files.

~~Please ignore this line~~

**This course has taught me about the differences between _Git_ and _Github_ I always found them very confusing but now i understand how they both operate **
**I currently ***do not have any*** <sub> concerns </sub> about this <sup> course and look </sup> forward to learning more :) **
