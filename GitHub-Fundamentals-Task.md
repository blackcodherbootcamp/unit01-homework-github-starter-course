# Things I have Learnt ðŸ˜€
- How to use CLI Commands
- What is Git and GitHub 
- The difference between Git and GitHub 
- Git commands such as:
`````

  git init to initiate git file
  git add [file name] to stage changes 
  git commit -am " commit message" to commit changes to a repositor
  git push origin [file name] to push changes content of a local repository to the remote repository 
  git status to get the status of the repository working on
  git log to get the history of all the changes and commit made
`````

- How to create repository both local and remote
- How to connect your local and remote repository
- How to add files to repository
- How to create a branch 
- Add file to the new branch
- Merge the new branch to the main branch, for example:
`````
 `git branch [new branch name]` to create a new branch
 `git checkout` to switch branches
 `git checkout -b [new branch name]` to create a new branch with all the history of the branch currently working on

 ````` 
- Git best practice: 
  1. Use branches to create new features, experiment and fix bugs
  2. Make small frequent changes to prevent lost 
  3. Write meaningful commits
  4. Use consistent tense and imperative language on commit messages

# Things I am Still Confused About ðŸ¤”
- Still on the push exercise. Getting error messages
