# **CBF Session 4 Homework**
## **Shanice Dunk's Pull Request**

In the CBF sessions so far, I have learned how to work with Git and GitHub which will help when working on tasks throughout the course and the final project.

The most beneficial skill I have learned is pushing changes from Git to GitHub and using the pull request. 

At the moment, I am not struggling on anything in particular as the more practice I do, the more I improve over time!
