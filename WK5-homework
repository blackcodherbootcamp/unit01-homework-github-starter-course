Heyy 👋🏽
I just learnt how to do this so excuse me if its kinda wrong 😂 This is my first markdown file for this repo which I will pull when I am done. I have been enjoying all the sessions so far. I was already using git and github before I joined cbf but I wasn't doing it in terminal so it was nice to learn how to do that. It was also nice to know the proper way to use these sites to its full potential to ensure that someone else looking at my work was seeing it the way I wanted them to. I am not struggling with anything yet but when I do I will let you know.
