# 👍 What I've learned from completing the course on Git and GitHub


I have learnt that Git is a piece of software that makes it simpler to manage different versions of your own software in a software repository. I have also learnt that GitHub is a place to share software repositories and collaborate with other developers. These tools make it easier for multiple people to work on the same software project.


**😆 Things I am now able to do after completing the course:**
- Communicate in issues
- Create branches
- Make commits
- Deploy a webpage to GitHub Pages
- Manage notifications
- Introduces changes with pull requests
