## How CBF Bootcamp is going so far 

Currently learning about Git and GitHub

Last week, I was able to learn about Windows Command Line and the different commands used. 

Its really interesting seeing how commands writtten in the CLI can create new files and directories.

Although, I do not know all the commands by heart and still have to check google or the cheat sheets, I know that with time and more practice, they would become part and parcel of me.
